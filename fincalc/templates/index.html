    <h3>Step #1: Pay Down Your Debt</h3>
    <p>
      For many of us, debt is an inevitable part of modern life. Housing,
      healthcare, car payments. The list goes on, but not all debt is
      inevitable. Things like reducing credit card spending or getting a more
      affordable car can save you thousands in interest payments. That's why
      many financial experts advise repaying all your high-interest (eg. credit
      card) debts before investing. Considering taking a loan to make a big
      purchase? Our
      <a href="{{url_for('views.loan')}}">Loan Calculator</a> can help you see
      the true cost first.

    <h3>Step #2: Invest For Your Future</h3>
    <p>
      Investing lets you make interest rates work for you. When you were in
      debt, interest rates meant you got back way less money than you put in.
      When you invest, its the other way around. Even investing relatively small
      amounts today can have an impact for your future. Try our
      <a href="{{url_for('views.invest')}}">Investment Calculator </a>to explore
      the possibilities.
